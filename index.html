    <h1>Depth First Search</h1>
    <p>Cursor goes through a randomly created maze by constantly checking all directions first. Order checking is done by Top, Right, Bottom, Left preference. When the cursor hits a dead end it recursively backtracks until it finds another cell that has not been checked. This process is repeated until every cell shows as checked.</p>
